## Chapter 1: Categories, functors and natural translations

### Categories

- A category is a system of related objects
- There is always some notion of map between objects, binding them together.
- e.g. group, topological space , map , homomorphism, continuous maps.
- Categories are mathematical objects
- Maps between categories are called functors.
- Maps between functors are natural translations.
- Monoid: A group without an inverse.
- Formally , a monoid is a set equipped with an associative binary operation and a two-sided unit element.
- A preorder is a reflective transitive binary relation.
- Duality is important in category theory. Every categorical definition , theorem and proof has a dual , obtained by reversing the arrows throughout its statement and proof produces a dual theorem.

### Functors

- We always need to understand the notion of maps between two mathematical objects.
- A functor is a map between two categories.
- CAT: objects are categories and maps are functors.
- Forgetful functors: Forgetting some structure or properties of a category.
- `Algebra is dual to geometry` : Algebraic objects are dual to geometric objects.
